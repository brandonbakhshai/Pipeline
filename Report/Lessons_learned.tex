If you want a box around your answer and that answer is an
equation then use \boxed{$$ equation $$} 

if you want to indent a block of text:
\begin{adjustwidth}{cm of right indent}{cm of left indent}
% paragraph to be indented
\end{adjustwidth}

if you just want one indent for one line 
use \indent per intended indent per line

A sections numbers automatically, so if the number of 
the problem is out of order it would be easier to 
just indent and bold the sections and subsections
and not use the \section{} kind of commands

\newpage makes a new page

$normal math mode$
$$Special math mode$$

to include an image use
\includegraphics{image_name}
image_name is the file name (.png) without the extension. The file
name cannot have any spaces or any periods other than the one before
the file extension.

To include a codeblock use
\begin{lstlisting}
ExampleCode(blah, blah)
{
	it does tabbing and everything;
	for (coloring of major languages like java){
		add the folloing to the \lstset tuple:
			language=<name_of_language>;
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Lessons Learned}
\section{Somya}
When working on projects of this magnitude many skills are developed throughout the
process, moreover not only new skills are developed but also you learn how to interconnect
your different abilities and work with other's strengths to accomplish something unachievable on
your own.
Among the things learned it is worth highlighting the in depth structure of a compiler, the
scanner, the parser, the different decisions to be made when designing a language, the
differences that they bring to the language itself and to the compiler, how to express your ideas
in terms of a grammar, teamwork among others.
Systematic weekly meeting with the Professor helped us a lot and we could gauge if we were on track. Staring early is a must, it will make the difference between an excruciating workload and a
project that has incremental manageable goals that develop toward a main objective.
